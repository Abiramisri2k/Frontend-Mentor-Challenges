## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this **blog preview card** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**Users should be able to:**
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- View the layout properly on different screen sizes (responsive design).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5 markup**  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, responsive design, transitions)  
- **Google Fonts (Figtree)**  
- **Frontend Mentor starter assets**

### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of:
- Using `box-shadow` for creating a layered, playful card effect.
- Centering elements using `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.
- Adding smooth hover transitions for a more interactive user experience.
- Writing clean, maintainable CSS with consistent spacing and typography.

Example:
```css
.container:hover {
  box-shadow: 16px 16px #000;
}
.container:hover h1 {
  color: #F4D04E;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to:

- Explore CSS Grid layouts for better responsiveness.
- Add accessibility improvements.
- Experiment with reusable components in React for similar card designs.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - CSS Box Shadow
- Google Fonts - Figtree
