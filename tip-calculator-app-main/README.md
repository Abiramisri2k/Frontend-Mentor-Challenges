- Using **data attributes** (`data-tip`) for cleaner logic
- Managing **active states** with CSS classes
- Performing calculations dynamically without page reload
- Validating user input (handling `0` and empty values)
- Structuring clean and reusable JavaScript functions
- Improving UX with visual feedback and error states
