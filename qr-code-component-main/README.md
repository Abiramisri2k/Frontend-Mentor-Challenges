## Overview

A simple and responsive QR code component built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal of this project is to replicate a clean and centered QR card design, improving understanding of layout, alignment, and typography in front-end development.

## My process

### Built with


- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS3** custom properties  
- **Google Fonts (Outfit)**  
- **Positioning** for centering  

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to **center elements** perfectly using `position: absolute` and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.
- The importance of using **consistent padding, border-radius, and font sizes** for better UI balance.
- How to import and use **Google Fonts** for typography customization.

```css
.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Practice Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout management.
* Focus on responsive design for various screen sizes.
* Learn how to make components more reusable with frameworks like React.
