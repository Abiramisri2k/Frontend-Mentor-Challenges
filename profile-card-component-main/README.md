## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to set multiple background images on the body using a single background-image property and control their positions:

```
background-image: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
                  url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");

background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;

background-position: left -500px top -500px,
                     right -300px bottom -650px;

```

This helped me achieve the curved shapes on the top-left and bottom-right, similar to the challenge design.
