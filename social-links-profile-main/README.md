## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned:
- How to **center elements** using absolute positioning and transform.
- How to use **HSL colors** for better design consistency.
- How to create **hover and active states** for interactive elements.
- How to use **Google Fonts** and apply custom font weights.

```css
.social:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to:

- Make the design fully responsive across all screen sizes.
- Add real social media links with <a> tags.
- Include hover animations and transitions for smoother effects.
- Rebuild this project using React and Tailwind CSS for practice.
