## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Google Fonts â€“ Young Serif and Outfit
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While building this project, I practiced:
Structuring semantic HTML for better accessibility.
Using ::marker to style list bullets and numbers (for preparation and instructions).
Applying consistent spacing and typography with CSS variables.
Designing responsive layouts for both 375px and 1440px screen widths.
Matching pixel-perfect spacing, line heights, and font weights based on design reference.

```css
.instructions ol li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Implement dark/light mode themes.
- Add small animations or transitions to improve user experience.
