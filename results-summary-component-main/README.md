## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Dynamically populate the results using the provided `data.json` file (optional bonus)

This project is a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, responsive design, and optionally, JavaScript for dynamic content loading.
