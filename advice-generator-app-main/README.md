## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- Modern CSS (Flexbox, clamp(), custom properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript (fetch API, DOM manipulation)
- Advice Slip API
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How to fetch data from an API using fetch()
- How to prevent API caching using a unique timestamp
- How to dynamically update text using DOM methods
- How to use clamp() to create responsive card widths

### Useful resources

- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)
- MDN Fetch API — great for understanding API requests
