## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How to position and toggle a popup based on the viewport size
- Handling show/hide logic using JavaScript
- Preventing click events from closing the popup prematurely
- Using media queries to adjust layout and popup design for mobile
- Creating a circular button with SVG icons
- Improving CSS structure using variables and spacing

Example of my improved learning:
```
shareBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  popup.classList.toggle('hidden');
});

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to improve:

- More advanced component animations
- Better click-event handling for popups/modals
- Creating reusable UI components
- Accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation)
- Using BEM or utility CSS for cleaner structure
