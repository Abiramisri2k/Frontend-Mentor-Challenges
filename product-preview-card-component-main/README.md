## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout  
- **Media Queries** for responsive design  
- **Google Fonts** (`Fraunces`, `Montserrat`)  
- **Desktop-first** workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Structuring clean and reusable HTML elements.
- Using **Flexbox** to create a two-column layout.
- Applying **responsive design** principles with media queries.
- Styling text with Google Fonts and managing font hierarchy.
- Adding subtle **hover effects** for better user experience.

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:

- Rebuild this design using Tailwind CSS or React components.
- Add light/dark mode support.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels and focus states).
